# Nike product-end website with TailwindCSS

This is a focused project-end website using TailwindCSS. Using Nike brand as an example for good-looking result.

The project has developed using ReactJS with Vite and TailwindCSS for styling.

In terms of Linter and Formatter, I've used esLint with standard rules and prettier respectively.
